## single row subquery

/* In single-row subqueries, we mostly use aggregate functions like:

MAX() → maximum value

MIN() → minimum value

AVG() → average value

SUM() → total

COUNT() → row count

Since these aggregates return only one value, we can compare that value with columns in the outer query using operators like:

= (equal to)

> (greater than)

< (less than)

>=, <=, <>
